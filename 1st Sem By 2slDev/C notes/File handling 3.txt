fseek(),rewind().
----------------------


fseek() is used to move file pointer associated with a given file to a specific position.

Syntax:

   fseek(file pointer,offset,position).
   fseek(p,5,SEEK_SET)
// pointer p will move in forward direction for 5 steps starting from start of the file.


	fseek(file pointer,offset,position).
	   fseek(p,-5,SEEK_END)
// pointer p will move in backward direction for 5 steps starting from end of the file.


	fseek(file pointer,offset,position).
	   fseek(p,-5,SEEK_CUR)
// pointer p will move in backward direction for 5 steps starting from the current position of the pointer.



file pointer: Simply a pointer to the file, which can be declared by using keyword
		"FILE".

offset: numeric value which determines the number of steps pointer would move.
	This can be both position and negative value.
	If positive value , pointer would move forward.
	If negative value , pointer would move backward.

postion: This arguement determines from where to start the pointer movement.
	
	a. SEEK_SET: It denotes starting of the file.
	b. SEEK_CUR: It denotes file pointerâ€™s current position.
	c. SEEK_END: It denotes end of the file.



Eg:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

void main()
{
	char x[50];
	FILE *p;
	clrscr();
	p=fopen("C:\\mansan3.txt","r+"); //r+ mode wont erase all the data like w+.
	if(p==NULL)
	{
		printf("\n Error! File not found");
		exit(0);

	}
	// Suppose you have "This is india." in mansan3.txt.
	fseek(p,8,SEEK_SET); // 8 forward movement from starting of file.
	fseek(p,-3,SEEK_CUR); // This is india.
	fgets(x,20,p);
	printf("%s",x);  // is india.
	rewind(p); //fseek(p,0,SEEK_SET);
	fgets(x,20,p);
	printf("\n %s",x);   // This is india.
	fseek(p,-6,SEEK_END);
	fgets(x,20,p);
	printf("\n%s",x);  // india.
	fclose(p);
	getch();
}
